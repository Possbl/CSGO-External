# CSGO-External

COMING SOON!


This was a cheat made for a friend which didn't want to pay for a CSGO cheat. 
Obviously the code is a messy bunch as alot of the code could be much cleaner. 
He just wished for functionality and didn't care about how it was coded so I just threw things together one at a time
which could've done much more efficiently. If that's what you like I suggest cleaning it up but other than that its not much.
